### Hi there 👋
At GitHub I'm part of the Sales organization, helping customers adopt GitHub!

📫 I'm located in Hillsborough, NC

Here is a list of things I enjoy:

* Spending time with my wife Molly and 3 boys, Will, Ayden and Robert and my Austrailian Shepard, Teddy 🦮
* Camping, hiking and exploring the outdoors 🥾
* All things automotive related, including working on, driving and ogling cars  🚗 🚙 🏎
