### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
At GitHub I'm part of the Sales organization, helping customers adopt GitHub!

Here is a list of things I enjoy:

* Spending time with my wife Molly and 3 boys, Will, Ayden and Robert
* Camping, hiking and exploring the outdoors in North Carolina
* All things automotive related, including working on, driving and ogling cars.
